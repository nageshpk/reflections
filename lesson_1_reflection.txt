How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff feature exactly pin pointed where the changes were made in a file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    At any point the program gets error after few changes while upgrading we can always go back to previous version of it thanks to file history which saves the changes made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro's of manual commit - 
	We can commit whenever we want.
	commit size can be big or small depends on us
	automaticall saving is helpful certain times when we do not commit manually
    Con's of manual commit - 
	We might some time miss on comitting altogether

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In some cases we will be working on multiple files all related to one project and Git allowing to save multiple files in one commit is really useful.
